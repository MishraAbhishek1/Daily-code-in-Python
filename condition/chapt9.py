# why we use condition >
""" ❓ Why use condition?

Because real-world applications me decision-making zaruri hota hai.
🔸 🔥 Without condition — no logic:

    Aap login banaye bina condition ke?

    Admin aur user ka alag page kaise dikhaoge?

    Payment successful/failed kaise bataoge?

    User input galat hai ya sahi kaise verify karoge?"""

# Example of a simple condition
raining = False
if raining:
    print("take an Umberalla")
else:
    print("No need for an Umberalla")
